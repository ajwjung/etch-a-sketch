# Etch-a-Sketch

This is another project part of The Odin Project (TOP). This project is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

The idea is to create a resizeable square canvas between 1 and 100 squares wide and when a box is hovered, the background color changes. The user can click the "Resize" button to provide the number of squares per side they'd like and the grid will resize. There is also a "Reset" button if the user wants to return to the default 16x16 grid.
